## In-Engine Terrian Builder
This is an overview of my terrain builder system as the final part of my game engine research project. It implements many GPU-based brushes for sculpting and painting the terrain of a large scene. It also has a foliage brush system and can render densely painted foliage. The terrain editor allows terrain assets to be created, saved, and loaded as part of the world builder workflow.

## Game Engine World Editor
This is my interactive world builder research project. It builds on my engine by adding gizmos for transforming objects, a gui for organizing the scene and spawning, an undo & redo system, and the ability to save scenes after editing them in the world builder.

## Skinned Animation System
A GPU-accelerated animation system. Converts animation data embedded in GLTF models into a runtime format, which is loaded as an animation clip in the engine. Compute shaders implement the skinning algorithm and bone data is piped into the character vertex shaders. The engine provides an Animator component which can be attached to a skinned mesh object to control the current clip and playback speed.

## Multithreaded Audio Engine
A low-level audio player in multithreaded C++ using XAudio2. Includes async loading for large audio clips, seamless clip streaming with callback threads, and a priority system for managing multiple sounds. The library provides an object-oriented programming interface for loading, playing, pausing, modifying, and combining sounds.
