  blurb: >-
      I built a terrain editing module for my existing engine that allows terrain assets to be manipulated with a collection of 
      GPU-based brushes. I devised unique strategies for utilizing the GPU to create a responsive system for designing a large, 
      detailed game world. I gained a deeper understanding of terrain systems, interface design, and the management of resources 
      between the CPU and GPU.

  blurb: >-
    I researched and implemented techniques to transform my pure-code engine into a desktop editor that can be used 
    to design a game world without the user needing to write code or recompile. This included a GUI, transform gizmos 
    for objects, scene saving and loading, undo and redo from a history, copy and paste, and an in-editor game launcher 
    for fast iteration.

- name: Skinned Animation System
  source: https://github.com/robbiegrier/Game-Engine
  video_id: PqgRhDOPucA
  blurb: >-
    A GPU-accelerated animation system. Converts animation data embedded in GLTF models into a runtime format, which 
    is loaded as an animation clip in the engine. Compute shaders implement the skinning algorithm and bone data is piped 
    into the character vertex shaders. The engine provides an Animator component which can be attached to a skinned mesh 
    object to control the current clip and playback speed.

- name: Multithreaded Audio Engine
  video_id: x-KcqYzr0SU?si=vIb_5ADD9-tx52yw # Note: we need si for local testing because the video has copywrited content
  blurb: >-
    A low-level audio player in multithreaded C++ using XAudio2. Includes async loading for large audio clips, seamless clip 
    streaming with callback threads, and a priority system for managing multiple sounds. The library provides an object-oriented 
    programming interface for loading, playing, pausing, modifying, and combining sounds.

- name: Space Truck Simulator
  video_id: RVm1o0vEtew
  blurb: >-
    I led a team of students to develop 'Space Truck Simulator', a virtual reality experience. I
    implemented a system to simulate a large area of outer space within the limits of the engine and I
    learned the fundamentals of virtual reality development and its layers of abstraction in Unity

  blurb: >-
    An analysis of object-oriented design patterns with a full recreation of Space Invaders.
